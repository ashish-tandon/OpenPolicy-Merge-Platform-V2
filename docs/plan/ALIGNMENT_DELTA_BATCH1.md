# Alignment Delta — Realignment Execution (Batch 1)

Date: 2025-08-23

## Deviation Analysis Summary

- **Intended Features**: 20
- **Actual Implementations**: 12,362
- **Missing Features**: 12 (60.0%)
- **Partial Implementations**: 4
- **Behavior Drift**: 59
- **Extra Implementations**: 12,310

## Realignment Actions Taken

### 1. Missing Features → Implementation CHK Items
Created decimal CHK items (CHK-0300.1 through CHK-0300.12) for:
- FEAT-003: Feedback Collection [P1]
- FEAT-004: Feature Flags [P0]
- FEAT-005: Data Dashboard [P2]
- FEAT-007: Email Notifications [P2]
- FEAT-008: SMS Notifications [P3]
- FEAT-010: Social Sharing [P3]
- FEAT-012: Offline Support [P3]
- FEAT-013: AI Enhancement [P3]
- FEAT-014: Authentication System [P0]
- FEAT-015: Member Management [P0]
- FEAT-018: Debate Transcripts [P1]
- FEAT-020: News Aggregation [P2]

### 2. Partial Implementations → Completion CHK Items
Created decimal CHK items (CHK-0301.1 through CHK-0301.4) for:
- FEAT-002: Session Tracking (33% → 100%)
- FEAT-016: Bill Tracking (40% → 100%)
- FEAT-017: Vote Recording (20% → 100%)
- FEAT-019: Committee Management (67% → 100%)

### 3. Behavior Drift → Refactoring CHK Items
Created decimal CHK items (CHK-0302.1 through CHK-0302.6) for:
- FEAT-001: Global Search API alignment
- FEAT-001: Postal Code RESTful conversion
- FEAT-001: Frontend function consolidation
- FEAT-006: API Documentation alignment
- FEAT-009: Theme System standardization
- FEAT-011: Print View implementation

### 4. Extra Implementations → ADR Decisions
- **ADR-20250823-101**: Adopt extra vote/debate endpoints as official features
- **ADR-20250823-102**: Evaluate MCP server integration
- **ADR-20250823-103**: Migrate legacy JS to /legacy directory
- **ADR-20250823-104**: Standardize development tools

## Key Documents Updated

1. **REALIGNMENT_CHECKLIST_BATCH1.md**: Contains all 32 decimal CHK items
2. **REALIGNMENT_EXEC_PLAN.md**: Updated with CHK mappings and execution priorities
3. **ARCH_DECISIONS.md**: Added 4 new ADR entries for extra implementations
4. **FEATURE_ACTIVITY_MAP.md**: Added mappings for all missing features

## Execution Priority Summary

### Sprint 1 (P0 Critical) - 9 items
- Feature Flags, Authentication, Member Management
- Bill/Vote/Committee completion
- Search API drift corrections

### Sprint 2 (P1 High) - 4 items
- Feedback Collection, Debate Transcripts
- Session Tracking completion
- API Documentation alignment

### Sprint 3 (P2 Medium) - 6 items
- Data Dashboard, Email/News features
- Theme System, New endpoint ADRs

### Sprint 4 (P3 Low) - 8 items
- SMS, Social, Offline, AI features
- Legacy migrations, utilities

## Verification Metrics

- CHK Coverage: 100% (all deviations mapped)
- Feature Coverage Target: 80% (from current 40%)
- Drift Resolution Target: < 5% (from current 4.7%)
- Extra Implementation Ratio Target: < 10% (from current 99.5%)

## Next Steps

1. Begin Sprint 1 implementation of P0 items
2. Set up feature flag infrastructure first
3. Complete authentication before member management
4. Resolve all API drift issues in parallel
5. Monitor for new drift during implementation
