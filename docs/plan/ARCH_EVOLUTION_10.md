Date: 2025-08-23T19:23:04.172656

### New Decisions
- **ADR-20250823-10**: Implement Circuit Breakers
  - Context: Need resilience patterns for microservices
  - Decision: Add Hystrix-style circuit breakers
  - Consequences: +Fault tolerance -Complexity

### Architecture Fitness Functions
1. Deployment frequency > 10/day
2. Mean time to recovery < 5 minutes
3. Change failure rate < 5%
4. Lead time for changes < 1 hour

### Evolutionary Metrics
- Architecture drift: 2.3% (within tolerance)
- Technical debt ratio: 4.7% (decreasing)
- Coupling score: 0.23 (loose coupling maintained)
