**Version**: 1.0  
**Analysis Date**: 2025-01-10  
**Iteration**: 1 of 3  
**Analysis Depth**: 10x Comprehensive Review

## Executive Summary

This document provides an exhaustive analysis of all proposed features for the OpenPolicy platform, evaluating each based on impact, effort, risk, and strategic alignment. Features are prioritized using a multi-dimensional scoring system with clear justifications for inclusion or exclusion.

## üéØ Priority Framework

### Scoring Dimensions

| Dimension | Weight | Description | Scale |
|-----------|--------|-------------|-------|
| **User Impact** | 30% | Number of users affected √ó frequency of use | 1-10 |
| **Business Value** | 25% | Revenue potential + strategic importance | 1-10 |
| **Technical Complexity** | 20% | Development effort + maintenance burden | 10-1* |
| **Risk Level** | 15% | Security, performance, reliability risks | 10-1* |
| **Innovation Score** | 10% | Market differentiation + future-proofing | 1-10 |

*Inverted scale: Lower complexity/risk = higher score

    async def summarize(self, bill_text: str) -> Summary:
        # Multi-stage summarization
        sections = self.extract_sections(bill_text)
        summaries = await asyncio.gather(*[
            self.summarize_section(s) for s in sections
        ])
        
        # Fact verification
        verified = await self.validator.verify(summaries)
        
        return Summary(
            executive_summary=self.create_executive_summary(verified),
            key_points=self.extract_key_points(verified),
            impact_analysis=self.analyze_impact(verified),
            confidence_score=self.calculate_confidence(verified)
