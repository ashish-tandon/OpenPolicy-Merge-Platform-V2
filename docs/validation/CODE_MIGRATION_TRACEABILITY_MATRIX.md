## Key Insights

1. **Best Preserved**: Infrastructure (100%), Scrapers (100%), Admin UI (100%)
2. **Well Integrated**: User Service (85%), Web UI (85%), API Gateway (80%)
3. **Partially Integrated**: ETL automation (60%), Committees data (20%)
4. **Not Integrated**: Mobile native app (0%), Boundary processing (0%), Email alerts (0%)

## Recommendations

1. **Priority 1**: Fix Votes API, implement Debates fully, load all committees
2. **Priority 2**: Automate scraper execution, implement email alerts
3. **Priority 3**: Add boundary processing, improve search features
4. **Priority 4**: Consider native mobile app, add real-time features
