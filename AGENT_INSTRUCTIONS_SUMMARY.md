# AGENT INSTRUCTIONS SUMMARY - OpenPolicy V2

## ðŸŽ¯ What Has Been Created

I've created comprehensive implementation instructions for the other agent to implement OpenPolicy V2 exactly as specified. Here's what's been prepared:

## ðŸ“š Documents Created

### 1. `AGENT_IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT.md` - Mission Briefing
- **Purpose**: Concise mission briefing with exact rules and priorities
- **Contains**: 
  - Implementation priorities (P0 bugs first, then features)
  - Required documents to read and in what order
  - Strict rules (NO deviations allowed)
  - Daily workflow process
  - Success metrics

### 2. `IMPLEMENTATION_INSTRUCTIONS_FOR_AGENT.md` - Detailed Guide
- **Purpose**: Step-by-step implementation guide with code examples
- **Contains**:
  - Implementation phases (Week 1: bugs, Weeks 2-4: core features)
  - Code examples and patterns to follow
  - What NOT to do (very important!)
  - Testing requirements (80%+ coverage)
  - Progress tracking methods

### 3. `AGENT_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Daily Reference Card
- **Purpose**: Quick reference for daily implementation work
- **Contains**:
  - Daily startup checklist
  - Essential commands
  - Progress tracking templates
  - Emergency procedures

## ðŸš¨ Key Points the Agent Will Follow

### 1. Fix Critical Bugs First
- **BUG-001**: Authentication system (P0)
- **BUG-018**: Database backups (P0)
- **BUG-002**: OAuth integration (P1)
- **BUG-003**: Rate limiting (P1)

### 2. Then Implement Features in Order
- Follow checklist items [3.1] â†’ [5.6]
- 50 features fully documented
- Each has exact specifications
- Priority-based implementation (P0 â†’ P1 â†’ P2)

### 3. NO DEVIATIONS Allowed
- Cannot add new features
- Cannot change API specs
- Must write tests (80% coverage)
- Must reuse legacy code when available

### 4. Built-in Validation
- `make docs-audit` - Checks compliance
- `make test` - Runs all tests
- `make verify-features` - Validates implementation

- Follow existing patterns exactly
- Write comprehensive tests
- Maintain 80%+ coverage

### Phase 3: Supporting Features (Weeks 5-8)
- Complete remaining features
- Final testing and validation
- Documentation updates
- Production readiness

## ðŸ”§ Built-in Success Mechanisms

### 1. Validation Tools
```bash
make docs-audit      # Checks compliance
make test           # Runs all tests
make verify-features # Validates implementation
make health-check   # System health
```

### 2. Progress Tracking
- Daily progress logs
- Weekly status reports
- Checklist completion tracking
- Feature implementation status

### 3. Legacy Code Integration
- Always check `/legacy` first
- Reuse existing implementations
- Follow established patterns
- No duplicate code creation

## ðŸš¨ Critical Success Factors

### 1. Follow Documentation Exactly
- No deviations from specifications
- Use established patterns
- Follow checklist numbering system
- Check legacy code first

### 2. Maintain Quality Standards
- 80%+ test coverage
- Comprehensive error handling
- Input validation
- Security best practices

### 3. Track Progress Religiously
- Update progress logs daily
- Document blockers immediately
- Track checklist completion
- Report status weekly

## ðŸ“Š Success Metrics

### Week 1 Success:
- âœ… All P0 bugs resolved
- âœ… Authentication system working
- âœ… Database backups automated
