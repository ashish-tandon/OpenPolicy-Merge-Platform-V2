# Repository Organizer Manifest

## Overview
This manifest documents the file organization process, listing all files scanned, their classification, and move decisions.

## Organization Summary
- **Total Files Scanned**: 379,570
- **Core Files**: 106 (essential, active, referenced)
- **Referenced Files**: 7 (mentioned, linked, important)
- **Legacy Candidates**: 379,457 (unreferenced, obsolete, superseded)
- **Organization Mode**: Dry-run (APPLY=0)

## File Classification Methodology

### Core Files (106)
Files in essential directories that are actively used:
- `docs/` - Documentation and planning
- `artifacts/` - Validation artifacts
- `.github/` - GitHub workflows and configuration
- `scripts/` - Helper scripts
- `Makefile` - Build automation
- `docker-compose.yml` - Service orchestration
- `README.md` - Project documentation

### Referenced Files (7)
Files that are explicitly mentioned or linked in key documents:
- Files referenced in Source of Truth
- Files referenced in Feature Mapping
- Files referenced in Validation Index
- Files referenced in Master Document Index

### Legacy Candidates (379,457)
Files that are:
- Unreferenced in key documentation
- Not in core directories
- Likely node_modules or build artifacts
- Obsolete or superseded code
- Temporary or generated files

## Move Decisions

### Files to Keep (Core + Referenced)
All files classified as core or referenced will remain in their current locations to maintain:
- Active development workflow
- Documentation integrity
- Build system functionality
- Service orchestration

### Files to Move (Legacy Candidates)
Files classified as legacy candidates would be moved to `legacy/<original_path>` to:
- Preserve original directory structure
- Maintain traceability
- Reduce repository clutter
- Focus on active development

## Directory Structure Preservation

### Legacy Directory Organization
When APPLY=1 is set, legacy candidates will be moved to:
```
legacy/
â”œâ”€â”€ services/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ nocobase/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ node_modules/ (and subdirectories)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ web-ui/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ node_modules/ (and subdirectories)
â”œâ”€â”€ build artifacts
â”œâ”€â”€ temporary files
â””â”€â”€ other unreferenced content
```

### Benefits of Structure Preservation
- **Traceability**: Original paths maintained
- **Recovery**: Easy to locate and restore if needed
- **Audit**: Clear record of what was moved where
- **Integration**: Maintains relationships between related files

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- Core and referenced files remain untouched
- Original directory structure preserved
- All active development files maintained
- Documentation and configuration intact

### Medium Risk
- Large number of files to move (379,457)
- Potential for long move operations
- Need for sufficient disk space
- Verification required after moves

### Mitigation Strategies
- Dry-run mode for validation
- Incremental application possible
- Rollback capability through git
- Comprehensive manifest documentation

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Dry-Run (Current)
- âœ… File classification completed
- âœ… Manifest generated
- âœ… Risk assessment performed
- âœ… Move plan documented

### Phase 2: Apply (When Ready)
- Set `APPLY=1` environment variable
- Re-run organizer script
- Monitor move operations
- Verify final state

### Phase 3: Validation
- Check all core files remain
- Verify legacy organization
- Test system functionality
- Update documentation

## Current Status

**Mode**: Dry-run (APPLY=0)
**Files Classified**: âœ… Complete
**Manifest Generated**: âœ… Complete
**Ready for Application**: âœ… Yes
**Next Step**: Set APPLY=1 and re-run organizer

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Review Manifest**: Verify classification accuracy
2. **Backup**: Ensure git repository is clean and committed
3. **Space Check**: Verify sufficient disk space for moves
4. **Timing**: Choose low-traffic period for application

### Application Process
1. Set `APPLY=1` environment variable
2. Run `python3 scripts/organize_repo.py`
3. Monitor progress and completion
4. Verify final repository state
5. Commit changes to git

### Post-Application
1. Update documentation references
2. Verify system functionality
3. Clean up any temporary files
4. Document lessons learned

## File Count Summary

| Classification | Count | Percentage | Action |
|----------------|-------|------------|---------|
| Core | 106 | 0.03% | Keep |
| Referenced | 7 | 0.00% | Keep |
| Legacy Candidates | 379,457 | 99.97% | Move to legacy/ |
| **Total** | **379,570** | **100%** | **Organized** |

## Conclusion

The repository organization process has successfully classified all files and is ready for application. The large number of legacy candidates (379,457) indicates significant cleanup potential while maintaining all essential functionality.

**Status**: âœ… **READY FOR APPLICATION**
**Risk Level**: ðŸŸ¡ **MEDIUM** (due to volume)
**Recommendation**: âœ… **PROCEED WITH CAUTION**
